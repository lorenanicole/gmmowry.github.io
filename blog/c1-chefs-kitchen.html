				<p id="blog-text">"Come in and make a mess," - Shereef Bishay

This past week has been really overwhelming. I have come from a background with zero experience in programming and development to getting thrown in the deep end with DBC. And don't get me wrong, I LOVE it!

Shereef's Fireside Chat (http://vimeo.com/85001014) is a great introduction to the culture and more importantly, the mindset necessary for a student of Dev Bootcamp. He explains his thoughts on "Restaurant" vs. "Kitchen" mindsets at DBC:

- Restaurant mindset is a more consumer-driven mindset, where individuals view their experience at DBC as something off a menu: it costs this much, they will get specific skills, they will learn this, and then they will get a job. They are upset when what they get isn't what they ordered. 

- Kitchen mindset is a more creator-driven mindset, where individuals show up ready to make a mess and start cooking something wonderful, no matter what their skill level is or how much they know. They view this as a collaborative effort, where they will get more the more the put in. 

I come from a background at an education non-profit with a very, very strong culture. We only get individuals for one, maybe two, years of service so having a strong culture is the backbone that gives them a common experience. Coming from managing those individuals, I know those who are most successful in our program (or DBC!) are those with a "Kitchen" mindset - who are willing to get dirty, make a mess, have a few failures along the way, because they know ultimately they are learning from each experience. The culture at DBC strikes me as very similar to the one at my former job.  

I have learned the most in my life not from my successes, but from my failures and changing myself based on those. Embarking on this journey, I tend to fully embrace every single time I mess up, every typo in my code, and every time I just can't seem to get anything to work right. 

I am excited to be back in the mode of student. I have been in the role of coach, guide, leader, manager, and sometimes even mom, to individuals for the past 5.5 years. I am excited to not have the answers all the time, to grow as an individual and professional, and to finally follow pieces of my own advice. 

The phrase that really stuck out to me from Shereef though was this, "this is still a huge experiment," since I feel like I am still an experiment: throwing different variables and things at myself to see which one works the best, which one causes the biggest reaction. Hopefully the DBC reaction will be explosive in an awesome way.
