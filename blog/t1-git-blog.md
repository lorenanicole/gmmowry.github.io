Version Control, Git, and GitHub

October 12, 2014

Today we're going to go over git, GitHub, and version control software. While these might sound foreign, don't worry! They're relatively easy concepts and we'll walk through them step by step. 

What is version control? And what are the benefits of it?
Version control is a way of tracking any changes that have been made to a file, a folder, code, etc. It keeps track of any changes that have been made to a file and stores those changes so you can go back to previous versions, correct mistakes, and more. Whenever changes have been made, version control stores a version of that file or document so you can go back to any previous versions of your file. Just like if you were playing a video game and came to a save point, you could always return to that point of the game. Version control allows you to access previous versions of the file after changes. It also allows  multiple people to edit a document simultaneously by merging changes from multiple users into a new version of the file. A common type of version control that many of us are used to is something like Google Docs that stores old versions of our documents and allows multiple users to collaborate on documents.
So, to recap, the benefits of version control are: tracking and keeping a file of changes, storing previous versions of files, multiple users have access to edit one file, and merging changes from multiple users in one file.

How does git help you track changes?
Git is a version control program that you can download onto your computer to work on files. Git allows you to copy files from online or someone else onto your local computer so you can work on them remotely. When you are done with your changes, you are able to save the version of your file and connect it to the original file, thereby changing the original version to your most updated file while still saving an old version and tracking all of the edits you ever made. Just like you would play a video game, get to a save point and continue playing, always knowing that if something got messed up, you could always come back to that save point. Git allows you to "push" your edits, which are known as "commits," to the file to save them, thereby altering the file. Git can also "pull" any changes that have been made to the file, so you are working on the most up-to-date version. Ultimately, Git ensures there is one concrete base file, a record of any and all changes, and that your file is the most up-to-date it can be. 

Why use GitHub to store your code?
GitHub is a social website that utilizes an online version of git where one can store files, collaborate with others on a project, or 
work on code/file simultaneously. GitHub is an ideal place to store code because, just like git, it tracks all edits and changes ever made (and who made them and when!), stores old versions of code, and allows collaboration between individuals. If for any reason something goes wrong with your code, you always have a back-up version. There is also the option to copy an entire file or folder, so you can make changes to a version of code that doesn't change the original version. Developers can share, copy, tweak, and learn from each other by having access to other's work and have the ability to copy and edit it on their own. The collaboration part though, for me personally, is the best part: individuals can work on a project simultaneously but not necessarily together, all the while "pushing" their edits to the file everyone is editing and "pulling" edits other people are making. This way everyone is working on the most up-to-date version of a file and their edits are merging.  
In relation to Dev Bootcamp and Phase 0, it's a way for students to have the newest version of the curriculum, learn how to edit and use git, and become familiar with the GitHub platform. 

So! That's a quick introduction to version control, git and GitHub, plus why they're so great.
