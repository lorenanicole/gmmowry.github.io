					<p id="personal">Hallo! I'm Glenna, a non-profit education manager turned learning developer, currently learning at Dev Bootcamp. I'm originally from Wisconsin, but also feel strongly connected to Chicago, my home since 2009.</p>
					<p id="mybackground">I came to Chicago to volunteer with City Year, an education-focused nonprofit that also ensures volunteers are growing as individuals and leaders during their year of full-time service. I became fascinated and passionate about the state of education in our country, especially in Chicago, and decided to stay. I joined staff and became a manager, and while I still feel passionate about education, I realized that I needed to know something more to make an impact. Which brought me here, to Dev Bootcamp, to learn programming and development skills that I hope to use to better our education system, empower our teachers, and teach our students.</p>
					<p id="interests">I have an array of interests but you can usually find me reading, talking about dinosaurs, oggling over animal skeletons and paraphenilia, eating cheese and watching the Packers, or playing Dungeons and Dragons or boardgames.</p>
